    Job hunting, job seeking, or job searching is the act of looking for employment, 
    due to unemployment, underemployment, discontent with a current position, or a desire for 
    a better position. The immediate goal of job seeking is usually to obtain a job interview with
     an employer which may lead to getting hired.
  </p>
  <p>Economists use the term "frictional unemployment" to mean unemployment resulting from the 
    time and effort that must be expended before an appropriate job is found. This type of unemployment is
     always present in the economy.Search theory is the economic theory that studies the optimal decision 
     of how much time and effort to spend searching, and which offers to accept or reject (in the context of a job hunt, or likewise in other contexts like searching for a low price). People in work who use their time off-duty to job search has recently become the norm due to new jobs being mostly temporary and/or part-time (usually with not set hours) or professions becoming freelance, 
    with people hired for individual projects rather than a lifelong job.</p>
    <p>Many job seekers research the employers to which they are applying, and some employers see evidence of 
      this as a positive sign of enthusiasm for the position or the company, or as a mark of thoroughness. 
      Information collected might include open positions, full name, locations, web site, business description,
       year established, revenues, number of employees, stock price if public, name of chief executive officer,
      major products or services, major competitors, and strengths and weaknesses.</p>
